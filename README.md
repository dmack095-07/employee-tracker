  ## Description:
  I created an interface for users to find information stored in databases. I used Node, Inquirer, and MySQL for this application. I constructed three tables in MYSQL to connect to the server. The user can view all of there employees by department or role. They can also add a new employee, role, and department to the database. This will help keep their company organized. 

  ## Installation:
  First you will install "npm i inquirer" then "npm i mysql". And lastly to view the tables you will install "npm i console.table".

  ## Usage:
  You can use this application to store, retrieve and update information into a database.
